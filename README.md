# üß† Alzheimer's Disease Risk Prediction App

**By Chenwei Pan**

## Overview

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by memory loss and cognitive decline. Early detection is essential for timely treatment and better patient outcomes, yet traditional diagnostic methods often identify the disease only after significant progression.

This project develops a machine learning-based prediction model using patient health data to estimate the risk of Alzheimer's. The model is integrated into an interactive web app where users can input their health information and receive risk assessments instantly with personalized lifestyle recommendations.

---

## Objective

- Build a reliable Alzheimer's prediction model using XGBoost with advanced feature encoding
- Provide an easy-to-use Streamlit web app for individual risk assessment with user-friendly categorical inputs
- Support comprehensive data preprocessing including target encoding for categorical features
- Deliver meaningful risk interpretations with professional healthcare guidance
- Offer evidence-based lifestyle tips for Alzheimer's prevention
