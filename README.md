## Overview

Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by memory loss and cognitive decline. Early detection is essential for timely treatment and better patient outcomes, yet traditional diagnostic methods often identify the disease only after significant progression.

This project develops a machine learning-based prediction model using patient health data to estimate the risk of Alzheimerâ€™s. The model is integrated into an interactive web app where users can upload patient datasets and receive predictions instantly.

---

## Objective

- Build a reliable Alzheimerâ€™s prediction model using Random Forest with hyperparameter tuning.
- Provide an easy-to-use Streamlit web app for uploading patient data and getting diagnosis predictions.
- Support data preprocessing steps including encoding categorical features and feature scaling.
- Handle imbalanced data through SMOTEENN resampling to improve model performance.

## Model Training (Summary)

The Random Forest model was trained on a cleaned and encoded dataset using these steps:

- **Data preprocessing:** Encoding categorical variables using `LabelEncoder` and scaling numeric features with `StandardScaler`.
- **Handling imbalanced classes:** Using SMOTEENN resampling.
- **Hyperparameter tuning:** GridSearchCV over parameters like number of trees, max depth, and min samples per leaf.
- **Evaluation:** Model achieved approximately 92% accuracy on a held-out test set.
